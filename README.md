# Flood Estimation Guidelines Pilot

This is an exploratory test of the potential for using GitHub to host an open, community-based, editable version of the Environment Agency's Flood Estimation Guidelines. 

You can use this to test how you could suggest edits to our guidelines and how we might review and accept these. 

No changes will be made to our published guidelines from this site. This is just experimental to test the process and acceptability to the community.
